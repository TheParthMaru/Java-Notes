# Method Overriding in Java

- If a child class has same method as declared in parent class, it is called as method overriding.
- Child class provides a specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class.
- Used for runtime polymorphism.
- Also called as Dynamic Method Dispatch.

## Rules

- Method must have same name as in parent class.
- Method must have same parameter as in parent class.
- Must be an `IS-A` relationship.

## Example

```java
class Bank {
  int getRateofInterest() {
    return 0;
  }
}

class SBI extends Bank {
  int getRateofInterest() {
    return 8;
  }
}

class Icici extends Bank {
  int getRateofInterest() {
    return 7;
  }
}

class Axis extends Bank {
  int getRateofInterest() {
    return 6;
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    SBI sbi = new SBI();
    Icici icici = new Icici();
    Axis axis = new Axis();

    System.out.println("SBI rate of interest: " + sbi.getRateofInterest());
    System.out.println("Icici rate of interest: " + icici.getRateofInterest());
    System.out.println("Axis rate of interest: " + axis.getRateofInterest());
  }
}
```

```
Output:
8
7
6
```

## Interview Questions

Q.1. Can we override static method?
Ans. No, because it is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with object.

Q.2. Can we override `main()`?
Ans. No because it is static.
