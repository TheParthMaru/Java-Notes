# `final` keyword in Java

- Used for restrictions.
- Stops value change, method overriding and inheritance.
- Can be used with variables, methods and class.

## `final` variable

- Used to create a constant variable whose value doesn't change.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    final int i = 10;

    i = 20; // Compile time error
  }
}
```

## Blank or uninitialized `final` variable

- A `final` variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable.
- It is useful if you want to create a variable that is initialized at the time of creating object and once initialized may not be changed.
- It can be only initialized in constructor.

## Static blank final variable

- A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable.
- It can be initialized only in static block.

## `final` method

- If any method is `final`, you cannot override it.
- But you can inherit a final method.

```java
class Bike {
  final void run() {
    System.out.println("Bike is running");
  }
}

class Honda extends Bike {
  // Compile time error
  void run() {
    System.out.println("Bike is running");
  }
}
```

## `final` class

- If you make any class as `final`, you cannot extend it.

```java
final class A {}

class B extends A{} // Compile time error
```

**Note**

- You cannot declare a constructor as `final` because constructors are never inherited.
