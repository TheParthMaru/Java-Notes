# Wrapper class in Java

- Wrapper class in Java provides a mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.

## Uses

#### Change the value in method

- Java supports only call by value, so it pass a primitive value, it will not change the original value.
- But if we convert the primitive values in an object, it will change the original value.

#### Serialization

- We need to convert the objects into streams to perform the serialization.
- If we have a primitive value, we can convert it in objects through the wrapper classes.

#### Synchronization

- Works with objects in multithreading.

#### `java.util.package`

- Provides the utility classes to deal with objects.

#### Collection framework

- Java collectiion framework works with objects only.

## Wrapper class for primitives

| Primitive type | Wrapper class |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| boolean        | Boolean       |
| char           | Character     |
| byte           | Byte          |
| short          | Short         |
| int            | Integer       |
| long           | Long          |
| float          | Float         |
| double         | Double        |

## Autoboxing

- The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as Autoboxing.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int i = 20;
    Integer j = i;

    System.out.println(i + " " + j); // 20 20
  }
}
```

## Unboxing

- The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing.
- It is the reverse process of autoboxing.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Integer i = new Integer(10);
    int j = i;

    System.out.println(i + " " + j); // 10 10
  }
}
```
