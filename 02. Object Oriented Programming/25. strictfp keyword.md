# `strictfp` keyword

- Use of `strictfp` keyword ensures that you will get the same result on every platform.
- If you perform operations in the floating-point variable, the precision may differ from platform to platform.
- That is why java programming language have provided the `strictfp` keyword, so that you get same result on every platform.
- So, now you have better control over the floating-point arithmetic.

## Syntax

```java
strictfp class A {} // strictfp applied on class

strictfp interface I {} // strictfp applied on interface

class A {
  strictfp void m() {} // strictfp applied on method
}
```

- `strictfp` keyword cannot be applied on abstract methods, variables or constructors.
