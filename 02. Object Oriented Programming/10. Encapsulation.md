# Encapsulation in Java

## Introduction to encapsulation

- Wrapping or bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit.
- We can fully encapsulate the class in Java by making all the data members of the class `private`.
- Then we use setter and getter methods to set and get the data.
- Java bean class is an example of fully encapsulated class.
- By providing only a setter method or a getter method, you can make the class read-only or write only.
- It provides control over the data.
- Way of achieving data hiding as other class will not be able to access the data through private data members.
- The encapsulated class is easy to test, so its better for unit testing.

## Example of encapsulation

```java
// Student.java
public class Student {
  // private data members
  private String name;
  private int age;

  // setter methods
  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }

  // getter methods
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }
}

// Main.java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student s1 = new Student();
    // s1.name; cannot access private data

    s1.setName("Parth"); // Using setter to set the name field's value
    System.out.println(s1.getName()); // Parth
  }
}
```

## Read-Only class

- A class which has only getter methods.

```java
public class Student {
  private String college = "ACPCE";

  public String getCollege() {
    return college;
  }
}
```

- The `college` value can only be updated hard-coding and by any setter methods.

## Write-Only class

- A class which has only setter methods.

```java
public class Student {
  private String college = "ACPCE";

  public void setCollege() {
    this.college = college;
  }
}
```

- You can't get the value of the `college`, you can only change the value of `college` data member.
