# Abstraction in Java

- Process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
- For example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
- Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does.
- We can achieve abstraction in two ways:
  - Abstract class (0 to 100%)
  - Interface (100%)

## Abstract class

- Class declared with `abstract` keyword is called as an abstract class.
- It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
- Abstract class needs to be extended and abstract methods needs to be implemented.
- It cannot be instantiated.
- It can have constructors and static methods.
- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

**Example:**

```java
abstract class A {}
```

## Abstract method

- A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.
- If there an abstract method in a class, that class needs to be abstract.

**Example**

```java
abstract class Bike {
  // Abstract method
  abstract void run();
}

class Honda extends Bike {
  void run() {
    System.out.println("Honda bike is running");
  }
}
```

## Example 1

```java

// Bank.java

// Creating an abstract class Bank
abstract class Bank {
	abstract int getRateOfInterest();
}

// SBI.java
public class SBI extends Bank{

	@Override
	int getRateOfInterest() {
		return 7;
	}
}

// Axis.java
public class Axis extends Bank {

	@Override
	int getRateOfInterest() {
		return 5;
	}
}
```

```
Output:
SBI rate of interest: 7
Axis rate of interest: 5
```

- An abstract class can also have a data member, non-abstract methods, constructors and even `main()` method.

```java
// Abstract class that has abstract and non-abstract methods
abstract class Bike{
  int speed = 100;
  Bike() {
    System.out.println("Bike is created");
  }

  // Abstract method
  abstract void run();

  // Non-abstract method
  void changeGear() {

    System.out.println("Gear changed");
    System.out.println("Speed is " + speed);
  }
}

class Honda extends Bike {
  void run() {
    System.out.println("Running safely");
  }
}

// Main class calls abstract and non-abstract methods
class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Bike obj = new Honda();
    obj.run();
    obj.changeGear();
  }
}
```

```
Output:
Bike is created
Running safely
Gear changed
Speed is 100
```

- If you are extending an abstract class that has an abstract method, you must either provide the implementation of the method or make this class abstract.
