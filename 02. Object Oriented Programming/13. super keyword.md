# `super` keyword

- Reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
- Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.

## Usage

### Refer immediate parent class instance variable

- This is the case when parent and child class have same fields

```java
class Animal {
  String color = "White";
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  String color = "Black";

  void printColor() {
    System.out.println(color); // Black
    System.out.println(super.color); // White
  }
}
```

- Here we are using `super` to access parent class property.

### Invoke parent class method
