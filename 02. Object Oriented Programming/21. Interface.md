# Interface in Java

- Blueprint of a class.
- Has static constants and abstract methods.
- Mechanism to achieve abstraction.
- There can be only abstract methods in the interface, not method body.
- Used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
- Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.
- Cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class.
- Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
- Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

## Uses of interface

- Used to achieve abstraction.
- Achieve multiple inheritance.
- Achieve loose coupling.

## Syntax

```java
interface interface_name {
  /*
   - All methods needs to be declared with empty body
   - All fields needs to be public, static and final.
   - A class that implements the interface must to implement all the methods declared in the interface.
  */
}
```

## Example

```java
// Bank.java
interface Bank {
  double getRateOfInterest();
}

// SBI.java
public SBI implements Bank {
  public double getRateOfInterest() {
    return 6.5;
  }
}

// HDFC.java
public HDFC implements Bank {
  public double getRateOfInterest() {
    return 7.5;
  }
}

// Main.java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bank bank = new SBI();
    bank.getRateOfInterest(); // 6.5
  }
}
```

## Multiple inheritance

- Only possible through interface.
- If a class implements multiple interfaces, or an interface extends multiple interfaces, it is known as multiple inheritance.

```java
interface Printable {
  void print();
}

interface Showable {
  void show();
}

class Main implements Printable, Showable {
  public void print() {
      System.out.println("Hello");
  }

  public void show() {
    System.out.println("Welcome");
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Main obj = new Main();
    obj.print(); // Hello
    obj.show();  // Welcome
  }
}
```

- Multiple inheritance is not supported in the case of class because of ambiguity.
- However, it is supported in case of an interface because there is no ambiguity.
- It is because its implementation is provided by the implementation class.

## Interface inheritance

- A class implements an interface, but one interface extends another interface.

```java
interface Printable {
  void print();
}

interface Showable extends Printable {
  void show();
}

class A implements Showable {
  public void print() {
    System.out.println("Hello");
  }

  public void show() {
    System.out.println("Welcome");
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    A obj = new A();
    obj.print();
    obj.show();
 }
}
```
